# Videos

MTV used to be AWESOME. I loved watching it when I was a kid. Now that we're in
the internet age, I've always wanted a way to just go to a website and watch
them, one after the other, without having to even think about it.

So, I've made my own!

## Running Videos

1. Clone the repo
1. Run `bundle install`
1. Run `rails s`

## Adding Videos to the Collection

1. Edit `config/videos.yml`
1. Run `rake db:seed`
